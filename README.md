# DEdgeAI Implementation
This repo is an implementation of our paper "**A Distributed Edge System for Accelerating AIGC Services with Latent Action Diffusion Scheduling**", **submitted to INFOCOM 2025**. We propose DEdgeAI, a distributed edge system with a novel Latent Action Diffusion-based Task Scheduling (LAD-TS) method that can orchestrate multiple edge devices for expedited and resource-efficient AIGC services. In this repo, we implement the proposed LAD-TS method, Baselines, and Refined SD3-medium (reSD3-medium) deployment in our paper.

DEdgeAI is implemented on distributed edge devices (e.g., Jetsons) with a refined SD3-medium model that is relatively lightweight and runs on a GPU with at least 16GB VRAM.

## I. LAD-TS Method
We propose a novel LAD-TS method that optimizes task scheduling policy by designing a latent action diffusion strategy, achieving near-optimal decisions quickly.

### LADN Structure

</div>
Compared to existing methods, our LAD-TS method utilizes the historical action probability instead of the Gaussian noise as the model input during the diffusion processing, ensuring a better offloading decision.

### Learning Performance 
<div align=center>

</div>
Our LAD-TS method achieves the lowest delay, outperforming the DQN-TS [1], SAC-TS [2], and D2SAC-TS [3] methods by 13.66%, 9.19%, and 6.32%, respectively, and closely approximates the heuristic optimal method's (Opt-TS) delay.

### Code implementation
The code of the LAD-TS method mainly includes the following four files: 

- `diffusion_lad.py`: This file implements the latent action diffusion processing.

- `environment_lad.py`: This file implements the collaborative MEC environment that is initialized according to the given parameters in main_lad.py. 

- `model_lad.py`: This file implements the LAD model that mainly includes the Mulit-Layer Perception (MLP) network, Actor, Target network, Critic network, and Network training processing.

- `main_lad.py`: This file implements the LAD-TS algorithm's procedure. In this file, some key environment and model parameters are given. User can set by yourself. For instance, you can set the variable NUM_TASKS = 10 that represents the number of tasks arrived to each BS is in the range [1, 10] at a time slot t.

### Test Usage
User can run the `main_lad.py` to achieve the corresponding experimental results.
```sh
python3 main_lad.py
```

### Install
To run this code, please install some key packages: torch, NumPy, and matplotlib

## II. Baselines Implementation
In our paper, we use four baselines: DQN-TS, SAC-TS, D2SAC-TS, and Opt-TS.
The baselines are implemented in the Baselines directory. All the baselines are implemented with the same setup in our experiments.

(1) DQN-TS baseline: The DQN [1] is a well-known DRL method that has been widely applied to various fields. In our experiments, we faithfully implement the DQN-based Task Scheduling (DQN-TS) method as a baseline with the same setup. User can run the `main_dqn.py` to achieve experimental results. 

(2) SAC-TS baseline: The SAC [2] is the state-of-the-art DRL-based method. We also implement the SAC-based Task Scheduling (SAC-TS) method as another baseline with the same setup. User can run the `main_sac.py` to achieve experimental results.

(3) D2SAC-TS [3] baseline: D2SAC-TS is the state-of-the-art scheduling method based on the diffusion model and DRL. This code implementation can refer the [release code](https://github.com/Lizonghang/AGOD).

(4) Opt-TS baseline: Opt-TS is an optimal method that selects the most suitable ES to process each task by enumerating all action spaces. Opt-TS provides the upper bound on the performance of AIGC services, but it is infeasible since the scheduler has no way of knowing in advance the compute and network resources available for ESs in the actual MEC system. User can run the `main_opt.py` to achieve experimental results.

### Install
To run this code, please install some key packages: torch, NumPy, and matplotlib

## III. Refined SD3-medium  Implementation
The source code of the Stable Diffusion (SD)3-medium model is released on the GitHub [sd3-ref](https://github.com/Stability-AI/sd3-ref). However, it requires a large memory (e.g., about 40 GB) to run, which is inappropriate for edge devices. Therefore, our repo implements a **refined** SD3(reSD3) medium service deployment that only needs 16 GB memory to run.

### Evaluation Results
The delay results of our DEdgeAI system and existing representative platforms under different numbers of AIGC tasks.

### Code Implementation
This code implementation is based on the original SD3 medium mode at the [repo](https://github.com/Stability-AI/sd3-ref). Our refined SD3-medium code is stored in the reSD3-medium directory that mainly includes four files:
- `refine_sd3_infer.py` - entry point, review this for basic usage of diffusion model and the triple-tenc cat
- `sd3_impls.py` - contains the wrapper around the MMDiT and the VAE
- `refine_other_impls.py` - contains the CLIP model, the T5 model, and some utilities
- `mmdit.py` - contains the core of the MMDiT itself

### Test Usage
User can run the `refine_sd3_infer.py` to generate an image.
```sh
python3 refine_sd3_infer.py
```
Images will be output to `output.png` by default

### Install
To run this code, please install key packages: transformers, torch, torchvision, fire, pillow, numpy, einops, sentencepiece, protobuf

### File Guide
- folder `models` with the following files ([download](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-medium/tree/main)):
    - `clip_g.safetensors` (openclip bigG can be downloaded in Hugging Face Platform)
    - `clip_l.safetensors` (OpenAI CLIP-L can be downloaded in Hugging Face Platform)
    - `sd3_medium.safetensors` (MMDiT model file can be downloaded in Hugging Face Platform)
- folder `dataset` with the file `Flickr8k_text.txt`. This file stores the text prompts those are extracted with the text labels from the public **Flickr8k** dataset.  We use the text labels in this file as the input of AIGC tasks in our experiments.
   
### SD3-medium Code Origin

The SD3-medium code included here originates from:
- Stability AI internal research code repository (MM-DiT)
- Public Stability AI repositories (e.g. VAE)
- Some unique code for this reference repo written by Alex Goodwin for Stability AI
- Some code from ComfyUI internal Stability impl of SD3 (for some code corrections and handlers)
- HuggingFace and upstream providers (for sections of CLIP/T5 code)
